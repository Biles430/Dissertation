  Abstract                 = {Wind-tunnel experiments in a thermally stratified wind tunnel and direct numerical simulations were performed to simulate the thermal internal boundary layer (TIBL) that developed over a coastal area in a sea-breeze flow. The results of the simulations were analyzed to investigate turbulence structure in the TIBL. To study the effects of the atmo- spheric stability over the sea on the TIBL, two vertical profiles of temperature were created in the upstream portion of the wind-tunnel experiment and the direct numerical simulation. Turbulence statistics of the TIBL changed significantly according to the temperature profile over the sea, indicating that the stability of the flow over the sea has a significant effect on the structure and turbulence characteristics of the TIBL. Furthermore, the TIBL heights were estimated from the vertical profiles of the local Richardson number. The estimated TIBL heights agreed with those predicted by a pre-existing relation, suggesting that both the wind-tunnel experiment and the direct numerical simulation accurately reproduced the growth of the TIBL.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been suggested that hairpin vortices may play a key role in developing and sustaining the turbulence process in the near/wall region of turbulent boundary layers. To examine this suggestion, a study was done of the hairpin vortices generated by the interaction of a hemisphere protubkrancee within a developing laminar boundary layer. Under the proper conditions, hairpin vortices are shed extremely periodically, which allows detailed examination of their behaviour. Shedding characteristics of the hemispheres were determined using hot-film- anemometry techniques. The flow patterns created by the presence of the hairpin vortices have been documented using flow visualization and hot-film-anemometry techniques, and cross-compared with the patterns observed in the near-wall of a fully turbulent boundary layer. In general, it has been observed that many of the visual patterns observed in the near-wall region df a turbulent boundary layer can also be observed in the wake of the hairpin-sheddihg hemisphere, which appears supportive of the importance of hairpin vortices in the near-wall turbulence production process. Furthermore, velocity measurements indicate the presence of strong inflexional profiles just downstream of the hairpin-vortex generation region which evolve into fuller profiles with downstream distance, eventually developing a remarkable simi- larity to a turbulent-boundary-layer velocity profile.},

Upstream of the step, the wall heat flux is zero and the velocity boundary layer is nearly self-preserving. The thermal-layer measurements are discussed in the context of a self-preserving analysis for the temperature disturbance which grows underneath a thick external turbulent boundary layer. A logarithmic mean temperature profile is established downstream of the step but the budget for the mean-square tempera- ture fluctuations shows that, in the inner region of the thermal layer, the produc- tion and dissipationof temperature fluctuations are not quite equal at the furthest downstream measurement station. The measurements for both the mean and the fluctuating temperature field indicate that the relaxation distance for the thermal layer is quite large, of the order of 10008,, where 0, is the momentum thickness of the boundary layer at the step. Statistics of the thermal-layer interface and conditionally sampled measurements with respect to this interface are presented, Measurements of the temperature intermittency factor indicate that the inter- face is normally distributed with respect to its mean position. Near the step, the passive heat contaminant acts as an effective marker of the organized turbulence structure that has been observed in the wall region of a boundary layer. Ac- cordingly, conditional averages of Reynolds stresses and heat fluxes measured in the heated part of the flow are considerably larger than the conventional aver- ages when the temperature intermittency factor is small.},

  Abstract                 = {A technique, based on the Lund et al. (1998) [1] approach, is introduced in order to numerically prescribe time-dependent turbulent inflow conditions in spatially-developing thermal boundary layers. A major difference with Lund’s approach is that the new multi-scale approach considers different scaling laws for the inner and outer parts of the boundary layer. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed for incompressible zero (ZPG) and adverse (APG) pressure gradient flows. To the best of our knowledge, the present DNS in ZPG flows at a momentum thickness Reynolds numbers (Re h ) of 2300 represents the evolving thermal boundary layer simulations at the highest Re h in the turbulence community. The tem- perature is treated as a passive scalar with isothermal walls as a boundary condition and a molecular Pra- ndtl number of 0.71. The predicted Stanton number shows fairly good agreement with empirical correlations, and experimental and numerical data from the literature. Moreover, the influences of the Reynolds number and the APG strength on thermal parameters are also examined. Furthermore, the bud- get of the temperature variance shows a significant increase of production, turbulent diffusion, and dis- sipation in the buffer layer at higher Reynolds numbers. The main effects of adverse pressure gradients on the temperature field are manifested by a decreasing trend of thermal fluctuations but an increasing trend of the wall-normal turbulent heat fluxes when normalized by wall units as the APG strength is augmented.},

  Abstract                 = {The `law of the wall' for the inner part of a turbulent shear flow over a solid surface is one of the cornerstones of fluid dynamics, and one of the very few pieces of turbulence theory whose results include a simple analytic function for the mean velocity distribution, the logarithmic law. Various aspects of the law have recently been questioned, and this paper is a summary of the present position. Although the law of the wall for velocity has apparently been confirmed by experiment well outside its original range, the law of the wall for temperature seems to apply only to very simple flows. Since the two laws are derived by closely analogous arguments this throws suspicion on the law of the wall for velocity. Analysis of simulation data, for all the Reynolds stresses including the shear stress, shows that law-of-the-wall scaling fails spectacularly in the viscous wall region, even when the logarithmic law is relatively well behaved. Virtually all turbulence models are calibrated to reproduce the law of the wall in simple flows, and we discuss whether, in practice or in principle, their range of validity is larger than that of the law of the wall itself: the present answer is that it is not; so that when the law of the wall (or the mixing-length formula) fails, current Reynolds-averaged turbulence models are likely to fail too.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements obtained in boundary layers developing downstream of the highly turbulent, separated flow generated at the leading edge of a blunt flat plate are presented. Two cases are considered : first, when there is only very low (wind tunnel) turbulence present in the free-stream flow and, second, when roughly isotropic, homogeneous turbulence is introduced. With conditions adjusted to ensure that the separated region was of the same length in both cases, the flow around reattachment was significantly different and subsequent differences in the development rate of the two boundary layers are identified. The paper complements, but is much more extensive than, the earlier presentation of some of the basic data (Castro & Epik 1996), confirming not only that the development process is very slow, but also that it is non- monotonic. Turbulence stress levels fall below those typical of zero-pressure-gradient boundary layers and, in many ways, the boundary layer has features similar to those found in standard boundary layers perturbed by free-stream turbulence. It is argued that, at least as far as the turbulence structure is concerned, the inner layer region develops no more quickly than does the outer flow and it is the latter which essentially determines the overall rate of development of the whole flow. Some numerical computations are used to assess the extent to which current turbulence models are adequate for such flows.},

At the lower reduced frequencies of the investigation, solutions could not be obtained with this procedure and it was necessary to introduce interaction between the viscous and inviscid flows. The solutions obtained with the interactive method were increasingly different from those without interaction as the reduced frequency was decreased towards zero and, for some combinations of Reynolds number and frequency, exhibited behaviour consistent with the instability of separation bubbles.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract--Five basic geometries (cylinder, cube, diamond, pyramid and hemisphere) are comparatively examined at a Reynolds number of 1.7 x 104 to determine the effect of a single roughness element on surface heat (mass) transfer. Local mass transfer measurements obtained using the naphthalene sublimation technique are substantiated by flow visualization. Results show that the upstream horseshoe vortex system and the inverted arch-shaped vortex immediately behind the elements are the dominating effectsin element- endwall interaction. Based on information concerning the extent of spanwise influence of each element, an inter-element spacing may be proposed for array configurations to achieve optimal heat transfer perform- ance.

  Abstract                 = {(Received 28 February 2002) The dynamics of the vortex structures appearing in an oscillatory boundary layer (Stokes boundary layer), when the flow departs from the laminar regime, is investi- gated by means of flow visualizations and a quantitative analysis of the velocity and vorticity fields. The data are obtained by means of direct numerical simulations of the Navier–Stokes and continuity equations. The wall is flat but characterized by small imperfections. The analysis is aimed at identifying points in common and differences between wall turbulence in unsteady flows and the well-investigated turbulence struc- ture in the steady case. As in Jimenez & Moin (1991), the goal is to isolate the basic flow unit and to study its morphology and dynamics. Therefore, the computational domain is kept as small as possible. The elementary process which maintains turbulence in oscillatory boundary layers is found to be similar to that of steady flows. Indeed, when turbulence is generated, a sequence of events similar to those observed in steady boundary layers is observed. However, these events do not occur randomly in time but with a repetition time scale which is about half the period of fluid oscillations. At the end of the accelerating phases of the cycle, low-speed streaks appear close to the wall. During the early part of the decelerating phases the strength of the low-speed streaks grows. Then the streaks twist, oscillate and eventually break, originating small-scale vortices. Far from the wall, the analysis of the vorticity field has revealed the existence of a sequence of streamwise vortices of alternating circulation pumping low-speed fluid far from the wall as suggested by Sendstad & Moin (1992) for steady flows. The vortex structures observed far from the wall disappear when too small a computational domain is used, even though turbulence is self-sustaining. The present results suggest that the streak instability mechanism is the dominant mechanism generating and maintaining turbulence; no evidence of the well-known parent vortex structures spawning offspring vortices is found. Although wall imperfections are necessary to trigger transition to turbulence, the characteristics of the coherent vortex structures, for example the spacing of the low-speed streaks, are found to be independent of wall imperfections.},

  Abstract                 = {An asymptotic analysis is developed for turbulent boundary layers in strong adverse pressure gradients. It is found that the boundary layer divides into three distinguishable regions: these are the wall layer, the wake layer and a transition layer. This structure has two key differences from the zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer : the wall layer is not exponentially thinner than the wake ; and the wake has a large velocity deficit, and cannot be linearized. The mean velocity profile has a yi behaviour in the overlap layer between the wall and transition regions. The analysis is done in the context of eddy viscosity closure modelling. It is found that k-&-type models are suitable to the wall region, and have a power-law solution in the yh layer. The outer-region scaling precludes the usual &-equation. The Clauser, constant-viscosity model is used in that region. An asymptotic expansion of the mean flow and matching between the three regions is carried out in order to determine the relation between skin friction and pressure gradient. Numerical calculations are done for self-similar flow. It is found that the surface shear stress is a double-valued function of the pressure gradient in a small range of pressure gradients.},

With installing the oscillator downstream of the tested tube exit, results showed that Nu is strongly affected by both pulsation frequency and Reynolds number. Its local value either increases or decreases over the steady flow value. The variation is more pronounced in the entrance region than that in the downstream fully developed region. It is observed also that the relative mean Nu either increases or decreases, depending on the frequency range. Although the deviations are small, it seems to be obvious at higher values of Reynolds number.

  Abstract                 = {The heat transfer from a heated $at plate to an airstream having large-amplitude jlow oscillations or a high degree of free-stream turbulence was studied. The frequency of the oscillation was varied from 34 to 680 cps at root-mean-square $ow amplitudes of as much as 65 percent of the mean flow rate. For both oscillatory and turbulent jlows, the heat-transfer coejicient was larger than that predicted by established relations in the literature. The hTusselt number with oscillations was as much as 65 percent larger than that with the wjerence flow at the same Reynolds number. The Nusselt number was correlated by a function of the Reynolds number and the ratio of the root-mean-square amplitude of the velocity excursions to the mean flow rate for both kinds ojflow. No e$ect of oscillation jrequency was observed that could be attributed solely to frequency over the range that frequency was varied. Schlieren studies of the thermal boundary layer revealed that flow reversal occurred near the plate surface at each frequency and also that the temperature proJle followed a periodic behavior. The time-averaged value of the thermal-boundary-layer thickness (given by the distance at which the temperature gradient attained a prescribed value) varied inversely with the Nusselt number. Although, in the oscillatory flow, the oscillations had a deJnite periodicity while, in the turbulent $ow, the oscillations were strictly random, the mechanism by which heat transfer was increased appeared to be the Same in bothJEows. The mech- anism appeared to be associated with turbulence and the transfer of energy from the free stream into the boundary layer.},

It is shown that the logarithmic law reflects a momentum cascade and that its structure agrees reasonably well with Townsend's (1961) model of a self-similar family of attached eddies, each of which contains, on average, a sweep-ejection pair, a segment of a large velocity streak, and disorganized vorticity. Those logarithmic eddies are themselves turbulent objects and can be studied in minimal simulation boxes that are much larger than those in the buffer layer. It is argued that, near the wall, the logarithmic eddies are probably the same as the vortex packets identified by experiments, but that their dynamics does not appear to be especially linked to the buffer layer. Further from the wall, they align into longer superstreaks, although the mechanism remains unclear.},

Above the modelled urban roughness, vertical profiles of the velocity and temperature were measured by a laser Doppler anemometer and a cold-wire thermometer, respectively. The estimated Obukhov length was found comparable or larger than the boundary-layer thickness, indicating very weak stratification. Passive-scalar diffusion was studied by emitting ethane gas from a point source on the wind-tunnel floor. Thermal stratification had substantial effect on diffusion even in the vicinity of the source where mechanical mixing by the model blocks was presumed to eliminate the stratification effect. &},

Many challenges remain in theory, scaling, physical understanding, experimental techniques, and numerical simulations. In this paper we distill the salient advances of recent origin, particularly those that challenge textbook orthodoxy. Some of the outstanding questions, such as the extent of the logarithmic overlap layer, the universality or otherwise of the principal model parameters such as the von Kármán “constant,” the parametrization of roughness effects, and the scaling of mean flow and Reynolds stresses, are highlighted. Research avenues that may provide answers to these questions, notably the improvement of measuring techniques and the construction of new facilities, are identified. We also highlight aspects where differences of opinion persist, with the expectation that this discussion might mark the beginning of their resolution. © 2010 American Institute of Physics. 关doi:10.1063/1.3453711兴},

In contrast, the estimates of the wake parameter are the smallest for channel flows and largest for boundary layers. Further, the Superpipe data are reanalyzed to reveal that = 0.41 is a better value for the von Kármán constant in pipe flow.

The wind tunnel is also equipped with a velocity profile generating cart, and surface roughness, wind orientation, variable area source, and sampling grid floor panels. Combined, these features can generate a wide range of thermal stratification and other conditions. The effects of neutral, strongly unstable and strongly stable stabilities on the flow were examined. Visualization by smoke tracer showed that in the stable case, the turbulence is damped near the ground giving a laminar-like, wavy streamline, while for the unstable case, large convective eddy motion is observed. The instantaneous w-component turbulent velocity near the ground for the stable case was drastically reduced from the neutral and unstable cases. Simulating a sea breeze. configuration, a strong stable layer developed over the sea, and at the shoreline, a mixed (unstable) layer began to grow beneath the stable layer. The observation of a downward flow in the lower layer near the shore was supported by a similar flow pattern in the streamfunction calculation.},

The wind tunnel is of a suction type and has a 1.5 m wide, 1.2 m high, 13.5 m long, rectangular test section. Designed to produce thermally stratified flows, the tunnel is equipped with two independent temperature systems, an air-flow heating unit (AHU) and a floor temperature controlling unit (FTCU). Using the AHU and FTCU, a wide range of thermal stratification can be generated with a wind speed in the range of(U = ) 0.2-2.0 m s - 1. Both in neutral and stably stratified flows, the tunnel can provide a uniform smooth flow with a low turbulence intensity of about 0.4% at a wind speed less than 1 ms-1. The design features and performance of the wind tunnel are described. The characteristic of thermally stratified flows created in the test section is also discussed.

  Abstract                 = {An investigation was undertaken to improve our understanding of low-Reynolds-number turbulent boundary layers flowing over a smooth flat surface in nominally zero pressure gradients. In practice, such flows generally occur in close proximity to a tripping device and, though it was known that the flows are affected by the actual low value of the Reynolds number, it was realized that they may also be affected by the type of tripping device used and variations in free-stream velocity for a given device. Consequently, the experimental programme was devised to investigate systematically the effects of each of these three factors independently. Three different types of device were chosen: a wire, distributed grit and cylindrical pins. Mean-flow, broadband-turbulence and spectral measurements were taken, mostly for values of Rθ varying between about 715 and about 2810. It was found that the mean-flow and broadband-turbulence data showed variations with Rθ, as expected. Spectra were plotted using scaling given by Perry, Henbest & Chong (1986) and were compared with their models which were developed for high-Reynolds-number flows. For the turbulent wall region, spectra showed reasonably good agreement with their model. For the fully turbulent region, spectra did show some appreciable deviations from their model, owing to low-Reynolds-number effects. Mean-flow profiles, broadband-turbulence profiles and spectra were found to be affected very little by the type of device used for Rθ [approximate] 1020 and above, indicating an absence of dependence on flow history for this Rθ range. These types of measurements were also compared at both Rθ [approximate] 1020 and Rθ [approximate] 2175 to see if they were dependent on how Rθ was formed (i.e. the combination of velocity and momentum thickness used to determine Rθ). There were noticeable differences for Rθ [approximate] 1020, but these differences were only convincing for the pins, and there was a general overall improvement in agreement for Rθ [approximate] 2175.},

Both data sets are analyzed using the snapshot proper orthogonal decomposition technique to develop a better understanding of the most energetic structures in the flow field. From the large window PIV, the most energetic flow structures are seen to exist downstream of the potential core collapse and lower energy structures are seen to exist closer to the nozzle exit. Performing the same analysis on the time-resolved data set provides insight into a specific region of the flow field, but windowing effects are apparent when compared to the large window results. The advantage of using the time-resolved data set is that a time-resolved, low-dimensional model can be developed. Overall, each data set has strengths and weaknesses and the results of this work provides insight into how each of the data sets can be used to gain a better understanding of the high-speed jet flow fiel},

The diameter of the pipe is chosen at 4.4 or 9.0 mm with a heated length of 2 m. The mass flux and wall heat flux are at (400 kg/m2 s, 30 kW/m2 ), (400 kg/m2 s, 50 kW/m2 ) (1200 kg/m2 s, 50 kW/m2 ) with a pressure at 8.12 MPa. By measuring the inlet fluid temperature and wall temperatures, heat transfer coefficients are obtained at various inlet fluid conditions. Analytical criterion for the similarity of the heat transfer behavior is proposed and the validity of the analytical criterion is examined by comparing it with the experimental observations. It is shown that by having same length to diameter ratio and wall heat flux to mass flux ratio a similarity of heat transfer behavior was maintained both in the normal heat transfer mode and deteriorated heat transfer mode. It is also noted that the flow at bigger diameter is more susceptible to the reduction in the heat transfer due to buoyancy. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {The boundary layer develops along a flat plate with a Reynolds number high enough to sustain turbulence and allow accurate experimental measurements, but low enough to allow a direct numerical simulation. A favourable pressure gradient just downstream of the trip (experiment) or inflow boundary (simulation) helps the turbulence to mature without unduly increasing the Reynolds number. The pressure gradient then reverses, and the β-parameter rises from −0.3 to +2. The wall-pressure distribution and Reynolds number of the simulation are matched to those of the experiment, as are the gross characteristics of the boundary layer at the inflow. This information would be sufficient to calculate the flow by another method. Extensive automation of the experiment allows a large measurement grid with long samples and frequent calibration of the hot wires. The simulation relies on the recent ‘fringe method’ with its numerical advantages and good inflow quality. After an inflow transient good agreement is observed; the differences, of up to 13%, are discussed. Moderate deviations from the law of the wall are found in the velocity profiles of the simulation. They are fully correlated with the pressure gradient, are in fair quantitative agreement with experimental results of Nagano, Tagawa & Tsuji. and are roughly the opposite of uncorrected mixing-length-model predictions. Large deviations from wall scaling are observed for other quantities, notably for the turbulence dissipation rate. The a1 structure parameter drops mildly in the upper layer with adverse pressure gradient.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT Small-scale turbulence has been an area of especially active research in the re- cent past, and several useful research directions have been pursued. Here, we selectively review this work. The emphasis is on scaling phenomenology and kinematics of small-scale structure. After providing a brief introduction to the classical notions of universality due to Kolmogorov and others, we survey the existing work on intermittency, refined similarity hypotheses, anomalous scaling exponents, derivative statistics, intermittency models, and the structure and kine- matics of small-scale structure—the latter aspect coming largely from the direct numerical simulation of homogeneous turbulence in a periodic box.},

  Abstract                 = {The swirling motion of fluids that occurs irregularly in space and time is called turbulence. However, this randomness, apparent from a casual observation, is not without some order. Turbulent flows are as abundant in nature as life itself, and are pervasive in technology. They are a paradigm for spatially extended nonlinear dissipative systems in which many length scales are excited simultaneously and coupled strongly. The phenomenon has been studied extensively in engineering and in diverse fields such as astrophysics, oceanography, and meteorology. A few aspects of turbulence research in this century are briefly reviewed, and a partial assessment is made of the present directions. [S0034-6861(99)03202-X]},

  Abstract                 = {THE DIFFUSION of temperature downstream of a step change in wall temperature or wall heat flux in a turbulent shear flow is of interest from theoretical and practical points of view. It is well known that. due to the quasi-linearity of the mean enthalpy equation, the solution to the stepwise discontinuity in wall temperature can be used to calculate an arbitrary wall temperature distribution [I]. Measurements. which have been made mainly in a turbulent boundary layer [24]. have been useful for testing various calculation methods [5]. To provide experimental data comparable to those previously obtained in a boundary layer. we consider here a step change in wall heat flux introduced at one wall of a fully developed channel flow (see Fig. I). The other (opposite) wall is maintained at approximately ambient temperature. The results are compared with those for a thermally fully developed flow obtained in a previous investigation [6] in which the full length of the channel wall was heated at a constant temperature. Hereafter, the fully developed thermal flow will be referred to as I; experimental details for 1 can be found in ref. [6].},

  Abstract                 = {Well-resolved measurements of the streamwise velocity in zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layers are presented for friction Reynolds numbers up to 19,670. Distinct from most studies, the present boundary layers undergo nearly a decade increase in Reynolds number solely owing to streamwise development. The profiles of the mean and variance of the streamwise velocity exhibit logarithmic behavior in accord with other recently reported findings at high Reynolds number. The inner and mid-layer peaks of the variance profile are evidenced to increase at different rates with increasing Reynolds number. A number of statistical features are shown to correlate with the position where the viscous force in the mean momentum equation loses leading order importance, or similarly, where the mean effect of turbulent inertia changes sign from positive to negative. The near-wall peak region in the 2-D spectrogram of the fluctuations is captured down to wall-normal positions near the edge of the viscous sublayer at all Reynolds numbers. The spatial extent of this near-wall peak region is approximately invariant under inner normalization, while its large wavelength portion is seen to increase in scale in accord with the position of the mid-layer peak, which resides at a streamwise wavelength that scales with the boundary layer thickness.},

A similarity transform reduces the Navier–Stokes equations to a set of non-linear ordinary differential equations which are then integrated numerically. Both two-dimensional and axisymmetric stagnation flows are considered. It is found that solutions do not exist for larger shrinking rates and may be non-unique in the two-dimensional case. The non-alignment of the stagnation flow and the shrinking sheet complicates the flow structure. Convective heat transfer decreases with the shrinking rate due to an increase in boundary layer thickness. 䉷 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on our direct numerical simulation of an incompressible, nominally zero-pressure-gradient flat-plate boundary layer from momentum thickness Reynolds number 80– 1950. Heat transfer between the constant-temperature solid surface and the free-stream is also simulated with molecular Prandtl number Pr= 1. Skin-friction coefficient and other boundary layer parameters follow the Blasius solutions prior to the onset of turbulent spots. Throughout the entire flat-plate, the ratio of Stanton number and skin-friction St/ C f deviates from the exact Reynolds analogy value of 0.5 by less than 1.5%. Mean velocity and Reynolds stresses agree with experimental data over an extended turbulent region downstream of transition. Normalized rms wall-pressure fluctuation increases gradually with the streamwise growth of the turbulent boundary layer. Wall shear stress fluctuation, !w,rms !+ , on the other hand, remains constant at approximately 0.44 over the range, 800" Re# " 1900. Turbulent Prandtl number Prt peaks at around 1.9 at the wall, and decreases monotonically toward the boundary layer edge with no near-wall secondary peak, in good agreement with previous boundary layer heat transfer experiments. In the transitional region, turbulent spots are tightly packed with numerous hairpin vortices. With the advection and merging of turbulent spots, these young isolated hairpin forests develop into the downstream turbulent region. Isosurfaces of temperature up to Re# = 1900 are found to display well-resolved signatures of hairpin vortices, which indicates the persistence of the hairpin forests. © 2010 American Institute of Physics. #doi:10.1063/1.3475816$},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Thermal stability changes the properties of the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer, and in turn affects the behaviour of wind-turbine wakes. To better understand the effects of thermal stability on the wind-turbine wake structure, wind-tunnel experiments were carried out with a simulated convective boundary layer (CBL) and a neutral boundary layer. The CBL was generated by cooling the airflow to 12–15 ◦C and heating up the test section floor to 73– 75 ◦ C. The freestream wind speed was set at about 2.5 m s−1 , resulting in a bulk Richardson number of −0.13. The wake of a horizontal-axis 3-blade wind-turbine model, whose height was within the lowest one third of the boundary layer, was studied using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (S-PIV) and triple-wire (x-wire/cold-wire) anemometry. Data acquired with the S-PIV were analyzed to characterize the highly three-dimensional turbulent flow in the near wake (0.2–3.2 rotor diameters) as well as to visualize the shedding of tip vortices. Profiles of the mean flow, turbulence intensity, and turbulent momentum and heat fluxes were measured with the triple-wire anemometer at downwind locations from 2–20 rotor diameters in the centre plane of the wake. In comparison with the wake of the same wind turbine in a neutral boundary layer, a smaller velocity deficit (about 15 % at the wake centre) is observed in the CBL, where an enhanced radial momentum transport leads to a more rapid momentum recovery, particularly in the lower part of the wake. The velocity deficit at the wake centre decays following a power law regardless of the thermal stability. While the peak turbulence intensity (and the maximum added turbulence) occurs at the top-tip height at a downwind distance of about three rotor diameters in both cases, the magnitude is about 20 % higher in the CBL than in the neutral boundary layer. Correspondingly, the turbulent heat flux is also enhanced by approximately 25 % in the lower part of the wake, compared to that in the undisturbed CBL inflow. This study represents the first controlled wind-tunnel experiment to study the effects of the CBL on wind-turbine wakes. The results on decreased velocity deficit and increased turbulence in wind-turbine wakes associated with atmospheric thermal stability are important to be taken into account in the design of wind farms, in order to reduce the impact of wakes on power output and fatigue loads on downwind wind turbines.},
