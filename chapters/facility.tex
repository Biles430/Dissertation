\section{Experimental Facility}

The NEAT boundary layer wind tunnel is an open-circuit in-draft type designed to study heat transfer in non-equilibrium boundary layers. Figure ~\ref{fig:tunnel} shows the design schematic for the facility. The key design component is the thermal wall plate used to control the lower-wall thermal boundary conditions seen by the flow.

\subsection{General Description}

The inlet section to the tunnel consists of a feed-back controlled resistive heater bank, a seeding manifold, a turbulent management section and a 4:1 contraction. The test-section of the tunnel nominally measures 303mm $\times$ 111mm cross-section and 2.75m in length and is made of plexiglass to allow optical access. Three BK7 glass window inserts of size 254mm $\times$ 102mm on the top wall of the test-section and located at approximately 45, 136.3, and 251.8cm from the test-section inlet are used for introduction of laser light and for infrared (IR) imaging. The optical quality of the glass inserts are better than the plexiglass walls and necessary for IR imaging. A feed-back controlled thermal wall-plate sits on the floor of the test section and is used to control the lower-wall temperature seen by the flow. The leading edge of the thermal wall-plate is a super-ellipse designed to prevent flow separation \cite{R.Narasimha1994}. The upper wall of the test-section is angled at 0.23$^\circ$ to closely maintain a ZPG condition along the length of the test-section. Downstream of the test-section is a rotor-stator assembly used to produce a sinusoidal pressure gradient, creating a non-equilibrium flow condition. The diffuser transitions the flow area from a rectangular to a circular cross-section where it connects to a belt driven centrifugal fan.  A frequency controller is used to control and maintain the fan speed and corresponding flow speed in the test-section. The freestream velocity in the test-section can vary between 1 and 12$ms^{-1}$. In the following subsections,  the components of the facility are described in detail.

\subsection{Inlet Section}
Air entering the test-section first passes through an OMEGA Engineering air duct heater (model CABB-1211/208). The 3-phase 208V heater consists of nine sheathed finned chrome steel resistive heaters that provide 12 kW of power (with a power density of 4.03 W/cm$^2$). The cross-sectional area of the heater is 390.5mm $\times$ 358.8mm with an open area of 859.4 cm$^2$ (blockage of about 39\%). The three legs of the AC power are connected to the heater through a Watlow Din-A-Mite C silicone controller rectifier (SCR) power controller. A type J thermocouple placed in the freestream 1m downstream of the test-section inlet provides feedback for a proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) controller used as the input for the SCR power controller. The SCR power controller, configured for zero-voltage crossover firing (as opposed to phase angle crossover firing) to reduce electrical noise, is used to regulate the duty cycle of the voltage (either 0\% or 100\%) to the heaters thereby controlling the freestream temperature.  A SCR power controller was chosen (over a mechanical relay or solid state relay) as it is more suitable for handling the large current (33.4A) needed for the heater and has a fast response time of 5.56ms, which not only allows for a tightly controlled freestream temperature but also prolongs the life of the heating elements by reducing the thermal fatigue.

The PID controller gains are optimized for varying freestream velocity and temperature conditions, as one set of gain values does not work well over a large operating range. This is achieved using the autotune feature of the SCR power controller-PID feedback system. The ability of the system to hold a freestream set point temperature is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:inlet}(a). 

After exiting the heater, the air flow passes through a honeycomb-type seeding manifold to introduce (if desired) tracer particles into the flow to be used for particle image velocimetry (PIV). The challenge with seeding an open-circuit wind tunnel is that the flow tracers must be uniformly distributed into the flow at the source. This is much more difficult than seeding a closed-circuit wind tunnel where the seed can be allowed to circulate through the facility to produce a uniform seed concentration. The custom designed seeding manifold is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:inlet}(b). The inlet air flows across the manifold through 248 PVC tubes of length 38.1mm and diameter 21.34mm. Four slots of 25.4mm length and 6.35mm width separated by 90$^\circ$ (center-to-center) are cut into each PVC tube. The plenum volume of the seeding manifold is filled with a dense fog of nominal 1$\mu$m  diameter oil droplets \cite{Shakerin1995} through up to twenty-three 21.34mm diameter pipes mounted around the perimeter of the seeder connected to a ROSCO 1700 fogger. The fog is drawn into the PVC inlet air piping through the four slots owing to the pressure difference between the fog in the plenum and the air in the PVC tubes. The open area percentage of the manifold (56.5\%) is comparable to the open area of the freestream heater (61\%). Next, the air passes through a turbulence management section containing 4 screens of decreasing mesh size and honeycomb. The screens reduce axial turbulence while the honeycomb reduces lateral turbulence. The air flow then proceeds through a 4:1 contraction to speed up the flow and to further reduce turbulent intensities.

\subsection{Thermal wall-plate}

The thermal wall-plate (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:wallplate}) comprises of twelve sections each independently heated and controlled. The design is modeled after the work of Blackwell, Kays, and Moffat \cite{Blackwell_1972}. Each section consists of a 9.5mm thick aluminum 6061 plate, Kapton polyimide-fllm resistive resistive heaters (affixed to the bottom of the aluminum plate) with a heating density of 1.5W/cm$^2$, and a 5mm thick calcium silicate holder used for thermal isolation of the aluminum plate. (The thermal conductivity of the calcium silicate is four-orders of magnitude less the aluminum 6061.) Three evenly spaced J-type thermocouples arranged spanwise in the center of each plate and embedded 2.5mm beneath the top surface of each aluminum plate are used to monitor wall temperature for feedback control of wall heating. The section components sit in a Delrin (acetal) frame, chosen for its low thermal conductivity and machinability. The streamwise (flow direction) length of each section increases with downstream position such that the convective heat transfer from plate-to-plate does not vary by more than a suitably chosen threshold of 15\%. This threshold is set by examining the smallest feasibly manufacturable streamwise plate length of the most upstream plate, as this is where the heat flux changes most rapidly. The length of the plates are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:plate}. To investigate turbulent boundary layers, a 3mm diameter trip rod extending the spanwise extent of the test-section is placed on the rear of the leading-edge nose, just upstream of the first convective plate. The rod induces transition to turbulence and fixes (on average) the starting location of a developing turbulent boundary layer.

\begin{table}[h]

\end{tabular}
}
\label{tab:plate}
\end{table}

The temperature of each section of the thermal wall-plate is monitored and maintained by its own feedback controller as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:tempcontrol}.  LabVIEW is used to define and implement the controller settings. Each controller consists of a 10$A$ SCR and an NPN transistor. The average temperature of the three embedded thermocouples in each convective plate serves as the feedback parameter to direct the SCR to block/pass the 110 VAC that powers the resistive heaters (effectively the SCR serves as a switch to quickly turn the heaters on/off). The time constant of the controller is significantly smaller than the time constant of any given convective plate so the controller can monitor and adjust the heat-input to the convective plate much faster than the plate can lose (gain) heat to (from) the flow. The operating plate temperature range is 20$^\circ$C to 65$^\circ$C which is set by the working temperature of the materials used. The controller is able to set and maintain a temperature to within 0.5$^\circ$C as determined from the variance of the embedded thermocouples during testing. Importantly, since the temperature of each section of the thermal wall plate is independently controlled, the design allows for the application of a wide-range of thermal boundary conditions: e.g., isothermal, streamwise temperature gradient, discrete temperature steps, among others.

\subsection{Rotor-Stator Assembly}
A rotor-stator assembly located downstream of the test-section is used to generate a periodic pressure gradient used to produce a pulsatile freestream velocity in the tunnel. Pulsatile flows are periodic and unidirectional characterized by both their frequency and amplitude. The flow over a half-period first accelerates to maximum velocity then decelerates to the mean velocity. During the next half-period, the flow first decelerates to minimum velocity then accelerates to the mean velocity.
In a pulsatile boundary layer flow, the acceleration/deceleration of the freestream velocity  produces non-equilbrium flow behaviors. In particular, when the oscillation period is comparable to (or smaller than) the turbulence relaxation time (order $100 \nu / u_\tau^2$, \cite{Peters1993}), there will be a phase difference between the oscillating strain and stress field \cite{Weng2016}. 

The design of the rotor-stator shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rotor_stator}. is modeled after the design of K.Al-Asmi \textit{et al.} \cite{K.Al-Asmi1993}.
It consists of a rotor with 4 uniformly spaced holes, and a stator with 4 matching slots. The open area to the incoming flow is continuously modulated which produces a smooth sinusoidal freestream velocity signal as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rotor_stator}(c). The rotor frequency is controlled via a DC motor with variable speed settings from 1-100Hz. Twelve air-bleed slots arranged on the stator control the ratio of fluctuating area to open area. The slots ensure the existence of a mean flow and by changing the ratio of fluctuating area to mean through area the pulsatile flow amplitude can be adjusted. In the present design, this area ratio can be adjusted from 40$\%$ to 100$\%$. The rotor-stator assembly was mounted downstream of the test section to reduce the effect of induced rotational flow within the test-section. The assembly can be easily removed if a pulsatile flow is not desired.

\section{Validation Tests}
The thermal wall plate is validated for three test cases: nominal ZPG turbulent boundary layer flow (1) over an isothermal wall plate, (2) encountering a sharp step in wall temperature, and (3) around a wall mounted hemisphere body.  Wall-normal profiles of temperature and velocity across  the boundary layer are acquired for case (1) and (2). For case (3), IR imaging is used to show that the wall plate can maintain a constant temperature even when the flow above the wall is unsteady and strongly three-dimensional.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Measurement Methods}
The temperature of the thermal wall plate and the spatial uniformity of temperature are evaluated using a FLIR SC645 IR camera and J-type thermocouples embedded 2.5mm beneath the top surface of each aluminum plate. The spectral range of the camera is 7.5-13 $\mu m$. The camera resolution is 640 pixel $\times$ 480 pixel and the measurement uncertainty is $\pm$ 2\% of the measured temperature. The measurement uncertainty of the J-type thermocouples is 0.01$^o$C as determined from examining the standard deviation of long time series collected at fixed temperatures. 

The wall-normal profile of temperature within the thermal boundary layer is performed using a sting-mounted type J fine-wire thermocouple with a probe diameter of $0.65mm$ attached to a Velmex BiSlide traverse with a step resolution of 5 $\mu m$.  A Titan Tool Supply Co. Titan Measuring A-1 Microscope-Telescope cathetometer, with an accuracy of $\pm$ 64 $\mu m$ was used to locate the thermocouple position relative to the surface of the thermal wall plate. 
PIV was used to acquire planar fields of velocity in the streamwise/wall-normal plane (i.e., xy-plane in the chosen
experimental coordinate system). %A schematic of the present experimental setup is shown in Fig. xxxx.  
Light is provided by a Photonics DM-series dual cavity Nd:YLF laser capable of 30mJ per pulse. A periscope and a 90$^o$ turning mirror is used to direct the laser light into the tunnel test section. Sheet forming optics (cylindrical and spherical lenses) placed prior to the turning mirror are used to form a laser sheet on the order 1mm thick. The laser light is scattered by atomized oil droplets of 1$\mu m$ nominal diameter introduced into the flow in the seeding manifold upstream of the test-section inlet. Images of the laser light scattered off the tracer particles perpendicular to the incident laser sheets are acquired using two 12-bit Photron FASTCAM SA4 CMOS cameras. 

The CMOS array size of each camera is 1024 pixel $\times$ 1024 pixel. The two cameras are placed on opposite sides of the tunnel and image the same plane but with different field-of-views (FOV). This is done to achieve high spatial resolution in the near wall region while still imaging the entire boundary layer. Camera 1 has a FOV ranging from 2mm $< y <$ 26mm and camera 2 has a FOV ranging from 5mm $< y <$ 54mm, where $y$=0 is the bottom wall. 

The PIV images were acquired at $3.6 kHz$ with a spatial resolution of $0.4\mu m$ per pixel and analyzed using LaVision PIV software, DaVis 8.0.6 and DaVis 8.3.1. Cross-correlation algorithms between two successive images are used to determine the particle displacement field and the time separation between the images is used to determine the velocity field from the displacement field.
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{ZPG turbulent boundary layer flow over an isothermal wall plate}
The freestream temperature  of the air in the tunnel is set to 25$^\circ$C and each section of the thermal wall plate is set to 40$^\circ$C. Measurements are acquired at five different momentum thickness Reynolds numbers, $Re_\theta$, as listed in Table~\ref{tab:temp}. The freestream velocity is steady with magnitudes varying between 2--10 ms$^{-1}$. The FLIR SC645 IR camera is positioned above plate \#5 located 0.8m downstream of the trip and the FOV is 85mm $\times$ 64mm in the spanwise and streamwise directions, respectively. The temperature of the convective plate was evaluated by ensemble-averaging 100 IR images acquired at 16Hz to reduce pixel-noise. The effect of averaging over shorter or longer periods showed no statistical difference between the results.

Fig.~\ref{fig:IR-ZPG}(a) shows a representative ensembled-averaged IR image of the thermal wall plate. The colorbar represents $T/T_{set}$ where $T_{set}$ is 40$^\circ$C. The range of the color bar magnitude is $\pm$ 5\% of the set-point temperature. Spatially averaging the corresponding image in the streamwise direction results in the averaged spanwise temperature profile shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:IR-ZPG}(b). Note that the spanwise variation is less than the measurement uncertainty of the IR temperature measurement which is $\pm 2\% \approx \pm 0.8 ^\circ$C.  In brief, the IR images show that the thermal wall plate can be held to a constant temperature within a tolerance that is less than the measurement uncertainty of the camera. The embedded thermocouples, located just downstream of Fig.~\ref{fig:IR-ZPG}(a) and at spanwise locations of 0 and $\pm$ $75mm$, indicate the spanwise gradient to be much smaller and that the tolerance of the wall plate temperature is $\pm 0.5^\circ$C.

%\end{figure}

It is first shown that the momentum boundary layer behaves as expected, through the agreement with the DNS data, and the collapse of the two mean velocity profiles demonstrates that temperature behaves like a passive scalar. The wall-normal mean velocity profile was obtained by ensemble-averaging over 30,000 instantaneous PIV vector fields and then spatially averaging over the streamwise ($x-$) direction. The corresponding mean velocity profiles from camera 1 and camera 2 were then stitched together following the method of Shea \textit{et al.} \cite{Shea2014} to obtain a profile that spans the entire wall-normal height of the boundary layer. The outer normalized mean velocity profiles when the thermal plate was at 40$^\circ$C and when the thermal plate was unheated is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ZPG-velocity}(a) (all other conditions being the same), where $U_\infty$ and $\delta$ are the freestream velocity and momentum boundary layer thickness, respectively. The same profiles plotted in so-called inner coordinates are shown  in Fig.~\ref{fig:ZPG-velocity}(b) (see Eq.~\ref{eq:lawofwall}). Here the wall shear stress was computed from the PIV data using the integral method of Mehdi $\textit{et. al}$ \cite{Mehdi2011}.  The agreement with the DNS data and the apparent logarithmic region of the velocity profile demonstrates the flow over the plate is consistent with a canonical ZPG boundary layer.

The wall-normal mean temperature profile was obtained by time averaging the thermocouple signal at a given $y$-position over a 100 seconds record length. Fig.~\ref{fig:ZPG-temp}(a) and Fig.~\ref{fig:ZPG-temp}(b) show the mean temperature profiles plotted in outer and inner-coordinates, respectively at five different values of $Re_\theta$ as described in Table~\ref{tab:temp} . Here 

\begin{equation}
\Theta = \frac{T_w - T(y)}{T_w - T_\infty},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $T_\infty$ denotes the freestream temperature. The inner normalization is described in Eq.~\ref{eq:lawofwallT}. The value of the wall heat flux needed for the inner-normalization was approximated using Colburns formulation given by 
\begin{equation}
St_T = \frac{q''_w}{\rho c_p U_\infty (T_{w} - T_\infty)} = Pr^{-2/3} \left(\frac{u_\tau}{U_\infty}\right)^2 
%q_w = \rho c_p U_\infty Pr^{-2/3} (T_{wall} - T_\infty)\left(\frac{u_\tau}{U_\infty}\right)^2 
\label{eq:qw}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $St_T$ is the Stanton number for an incompressible boundary layer flow over an isothermal plate. Collectively, the two plots demonstrate that the measured temperature profile is consistent with a ZPG boundary layer over an isothermal wall with heat transfer.

\subsection{ZPG boundary layer encountering a sharp step in wall temperature}

\caption{(a) Representative ensemble-averaged IR image of temperature step. The top-plate is unheated where T=$25^\circ$C and the bottom plate is set to T=40$^\circ$C. The flow is from top-to-bottom. (b) The streamwise profile of spanwise averaged temperature.} 
\label{fig:IR-STEP}
\end{figure*}

In this configuration, a ZPG turbulent boundary layer initially develops over an unheated portion of the wall-plate and then encounters a sharp one-dimensional step in wall temperature at some distance $x_T$ downstream of the boundary layer trip. Effectively, a thermal boundary develops internal to an existing turbulent momentum boundary layer. The configuration is relevant to a flow where a boundary layer encounters a change in surface conditions such as when the atmospheric boundary layer flows from sea to land or when the flow over an engineered surface flows from a cold region to a hot region.  Owing to its importance in both geophysical flows and engineering systems, this particular flow configuration has been fairly well-studied in the literature \cite{Antonia1977,Hoffmann1979, Moretti1965} and is therefore an appropriate test case for validating the NEAT boundary layer facility. 

In the present study, the length of the unheated portion of the wall plate is varied by systematically changing the start location of the temperature step relative to the trip position. A sting-mounted type J fine-wire ($0.65mm$ probe diameter) thermocouple attached to a Velmex BiSlide traverse was placed $1.26m$ downstream of the trip (i.e., in the middle of plate $\#$9). The freestream velocity was set to $4ms^{-1}$ and wall-normal temperature profiles were acquired for varying unheated starting lengths. The temperature of the convective plate where the temperature step occurred and those downstream of the step were set to $40^\circ$C while the convective plates upstream of the step were unheated. In terms of the convective plate numbers, the first profile was acquired when only plate \#9 was heated, the second profile was acquired when plates \#8 and \#9 were heated and so forth until the last profile was acquired when plates \#1-9 were heated.  Note that in this configuration, the thickness of the momentum boundary layer within which the thermal boundary layer begins to grow varies from profile to profile. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:IR-STEP}(a) shows a representative ensembled-averaged IR image of the temperature step. The flow is from top-to-bottom and the colorbar represents the surface temperature of the plate. The top-plate is unheated where $T=25^\circ$C and the bottom plate is set to $T=40^\circ$C.  Fig.~\ref{fig:IR-STEP}(b) shows the mean streamwise temperature profile obtained by spatially averaging in the spanwise direction. The thermal jump is considered a sharp thermal interface with a thermal gradient of 450$^\circ$C per meter ($0.45^\circ$C/mm), which is greater than that investigated by Moretti $\textit{ et al.}$ \cite{Moretti1965}. Note that the temperature of the insulating region separating the plates cannot be accurately determined from the IR images owing to the difference in emissivity between the insulated region and the convective plate. The embedded thermocouples show the temperature difference between the two plates to be 15 $^\circ$C.

The wall-normal (y-direction) mean temperature profile was obtained by time averaging the thermocouple signal at a given $y$-position over a record length of 100 seconds ($\approx1000 \delta/u_\tau$). Fig.~\ref{fig:Step-temp} shows the mean temperature profiles plotted in outer and inner coordinates for the nine different unheated starting lengths. Owing to the difficulty of evaluating $\delta_T$ for short thermal development lengths (i.e, large $x_T$ with fixed profile measurement location), the so-called thermal displacement thickness given by 

\begin{equation}
\delta_T^* = \int_0^\infty \frac{T(y) - T_\infty}{T_w - T_\infty} dy,
\end{equation}

\noindent was used for outer normalization \cite{Antonia1977}.  The wall heat flux values used for inner-normalization is determined from the correlation 

\begin{equation}
St(x) = St_T \left[ 1 - \left(\frac{x_T}{x}\right)^{9/10}\right]^{-1/9}
%St(x) = 0.0287 Re_x^{-0.2}Pr^{-0.4} \left[ 1 - \left(\frac{x_T}{x_o}\right)^{9/10}\right]^{-1/9}

\noindent developed by \cite{Reynolds1958} as as an approximate solution for the heat transfer downstream of a wall temperature step in a ZPG boundary layer flow, where $St_T$ is given by Eq.~\ref{eq:qw} and $x_T$ is the unheated starting length. The profiles (each shifted by $\Theta^+ = 6$) show approximate collapse on the expected turbulent profile (dashed lines in the figure) that improves with decreasing $x_T$ . These datasets demonstrate that the flow over the plate encountering a wall temperature step is consistent with previous studies \cite{Reynolds1958, Hoffmann1979}, validating the ability of the thermal wall plate to produce temperature step wall boundary conditions.

\subsection{ZPG turbulent boundary layer flow around a wall mounted hemisphere body}

When a boundary layer flow encounters a wall-mounted hemisphere body, the pressure gradients around the hemisphere lead to the formation of a necklace vortex at the hemisphere base with legs that extend downstream \cite{simpson2001}. Flow separation at the top of the hemisphere produces vortex loops in the near-wake region \cite{Savory1986,Hansen1975}. The vorticity in far wake structure is comprised of both the necklace vortex and the vortex loops (see Fig.~\ref{fig:HEMI-Cartoon}). The influence of these types of fluid-structure interactions on heat transfer are important across a broad range of problems from flow over glaciers to atmospheric re-entry vehicles. 

In the present study, a wall mounted hemisphere body of diameter D = 3cm was placed on the leading edge nose just upstream of the first convective wall plate. 
The boundary layer upstream of the hemisphere is laminar and the boundary layer is thin compared to the hemisphere with $\delta/D \approx 0.1$.  The set point temperature of the convective wall plate was 60$^\circ$C. The inlet air was unheated with $T_\infty = 23^\circ$C. IR images of the thermal wall plate were acquired downstream of the hemisphere with an imaged area from $4.5 \lessapprox X/D \lessapprox 8.2$ (i.e., near the trailing edge of the first conductive wall plate) and from $-3.0 \lessapprox Z/D \lessapprox 2.5$, where $Z/D=0$ denotes the centerline of the hemisphere in the streamwise direction. 
Ensemble-averaged IR images of the spatial distribution of the wall plate temperature at four values of $Re_D$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:IR-HEMI}. The colormap corresponds to the plate temperature normalized by the average temperature of the plate.  

The spatial distribution of temperature in the IR images show a distinct pattern that becomes more pronounced with increasing $Re_D$. The spatial pattern of temperature indicates that wake vorticity carries cold freestream fluid towards the wall near the plane of symmetry (i.e. near $Z/D = 0$ in the figure). The tapered pattern of minimum temperature (maximum heat transfer) is consistent with the study of \cite{Chyu1996} where local mass (heat) transfer measurements were acquired using naphthalene sublimation that showed a similar tapered shape and that the maximum heat transfer occurred near the reattachment point (which is likely upstream the measurement field-of-view near $X/D \approx 2.5$.) The high temperature lopes in the pattern likely result from the spanwise motion of high temperature fluid along the wall (see Fig.~\ref{fig:HEMI-Cartoon} plane view). Moreover, the center of the lope is likely a signature of the vortex structure driving the spanwise motion.

While the pattern observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:IR-HEMI} is interesting and informative of the flow structure above the plate, it is evident that the wall-plate temperature is not constant as desired but varies by approximately $\pm$5\% across the convective plate. The difficulty of course is that large spatial variations in the convective heat transfer coefficient exist across the convective plate owing to the strong three dimensionality of the flow behind the hemisphere. Since the design purpose was to set and hold fixed the convective wall plate temperature at a desired temperature, the design needed to be modified. This was accomplished by first replacing each of the two center thin film resistive heaters by two heaters of half the original size, now giving 4 separate heaters in the middle section of the convective plate. Next, the number of controllers was increased from one to two, one for each half of the convective plate. Then the number of controllers was increased from two to three controllers, where the center controller was used for the center two resistive heaters and the remaining two controllers were used for the left and right section of the plate. The mean spanwise temperature profile obtained by spatially averaging in the streamwise direction is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hemi-control}  for each control scheme at $Re_D = 2.4 \times 10^4$. 

The profiles for two and three controllers shows that the spatial variation is further reduced by increasing the number of independent controllers. By using three controllers, the spatial variation of temperature is within $\pm$ 1\% which is less than the measurement uncertainty of the IR temperature measurement. Given this lack of resolution it is difficult to assess the apparent asymmetry in the profiles but a reasonable assumption is that the asymmetry is likely due to somewhat different responses of the left and right controller. In brief, these results demonstrate the ability of the thermal wall plate design to be easily adjusted to maintain a nearly uniform wall temperature in a highly three-dimensional flow.
