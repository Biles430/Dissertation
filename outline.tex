{\bf abstract}
\vspace{-.5cm}
\newline
\noindent\rule{8cm}{0.4pt}\\
Already written from proposal, need to review and remove information about high Re work.
Leave room at end to detail results of thermal pulsatile work.\\
\vspace{.5cm}

{\bf introduction}
\vspace{-.5cm}
\newline
\noindent\rule{8cm}{0.4pt}\\
Pulled introduction from proposal, needs to be reworked to remove high Re info.
As work writing progresses dump references into intro chapter with brief summary to then expand on later.\\


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\bf theory}
\vspace{-.5cm}
\newline
\noindent\rule{8cm}{0.4pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Need to think about what this will contain and how it will differ from methods
\item mean int method?
\end{itemize}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\bf exp-methods}
\vspace{-.5cm}
\newline
\noindent\rule{8cm}{0.4pt}\\
expand upon methods shown in validation paper\\



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\bf NEAT tunnel}
\vspace{-.5cm}
\newline
\noindent\rule{8cm}{0.4pt}\\
-details the development and validation of tunnel.
Pull from validation paper.\\
why are sub figures not working? and template does not like subfigure package

{\bf Thermal Pulsatile Flow}
\vspace{-.5cm}
\newline
\noindent\rule{8cm}{0.4pt}\\
pulsatile flow
\begin{itemize}
\item velocity field
\item thermal field
\end{itemize}
