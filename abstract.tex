The need to reliably analyze, predict, and control the transport of mass, momentum, and energy in turbulent boundary layers is critically important across a broad spectrum of technological applications and scientific disciplines.
While there has been extensive--and--continuing research investigating laboratory-scale canonical wall-bounded flows, beyond the scope of these well-studied flows there exists a broad range of application relevant flows that are far less studied.
The theme of my dissertation research is to study such flows. 
The specific objective is to advance the knowledge based of boundary layer dynamics at high Reynolds number and in non-equilibrium. 
The strategy employed to achieve this objective is to perform detailed experimental measurements in purpose built facilities. 
The experimental measurement data will be analyzed within a first-principles framework to better understand the underlying flow physics of boundary dynamics at high Reynolds number and when influenced by non-equilibrium effects.
